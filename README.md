# BirthdayNotifierApp

Birthday Notifier is a simple Kotlin Android application used to send WhatsApp birthday greetings. It stores birthday data in Firebase Firestore and allows editing the list from the phone. The app schedules a daily alarm to check birthdays and can also be triggered manually.

## Features

- Google Sign-In using Firebase Authentication.
- Birthdays stored in Firestore for the logged user.
- Daily check via `AlarmManager` and `BroadcastReceiver` at a user configurable time.
- Alarm automatically rescheduled after reboot so notifications work even if the device restarts.
- Sends a notification that opens WhatsApp with a preâ€‘filled message.
- Simple editor to add, edit or delete birthday entries.
- Personalized greeting per contact.
- Option to import name and phone from your device contacts when adding a birthday.
- Manual trigger button for testing birthday notifications.

## Building

The project is a standard Gradle Android application. To build you need the Android SDK and a valid `google-services.json` for your Firebase project.

1. Install Android Studio or the command line SDK.
2. Create a `local.properties` file in the `BirthdayNotifierApp` directory with:
   ```
   sdk.dir=/path/to/Android/sdk
   ```
3. Place your `google-services.json` file under `BirthdayNotifierApp/app/`.
4. Run:
   ```
   ./gradlew assembleDebug
   ```

## Running

After installing the debug APK on a device, sign in with Google. Use the **Test** button to send notifications immediately or open the birthday list to manage your entries. The app will automatically run each day at the configured time (9 AM by default) to send WhatsApp messages to matching birthdays. The time can be changed from the Settings screen.
